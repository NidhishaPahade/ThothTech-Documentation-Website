<Steps>

1. Install Git

   Before you start, ensure you have Git installed on your system.

   - Windows: Download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer.
   - macOS: Git should already be installed, but you can install it with
     [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command in your terminal:

     ```shell
     brew install git
     ```

   - Linux: Install using the package manager in the terminal with the following command:

     ```shell
     sudo apt-get install git
     ```

2. Download and Install VS Code

   - Download VS Code: Visit the official VS Code download page and select the appropriate installer
     for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Install VS Code:
     - Windows: Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the installation wizard.
     - macOS: Open the .dmg file and drag the Visual Studio Code icon to the Applications folder.
     - Linux: Install using the appropriate package manager or by downloading the .deb or .rpm
       package from the website.
   - Launch VS Code: Once installed, launch Visual Studio Code.

3. Download and Install Node.js

   - Download Node.js: Go to the official Node.js website(link) and download the LTS version for
     your operating system.
   - Install Node.js:

     - Windows: Run the downloaded .msi file and follow the installation wizard.
     - macOS: Open the .pkg file and follow the instructions.
     - Linux: You can use a package manager or install it from NodeSource.

   - Verify Installation: Open a terminal (or command prompt) and check if Node.js is installed
     correctly by running: `node -v` This should return the version number of Node.js. Also, verify
     the installation of npm (Node Package Manager) by running: `npm -v` This should return the
     version of npm installed.

4. Fork a GitHub Repository

   - Log in to GitHub: Go to [GitHub] and log in.
   - Find the Repository: Navigate to the splashKit repository (link).
   - Fork the Repo: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This will
     create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

5. Clone the Forked Repository

   - Copy the URL: Go to your forked repository, click on the green "Code" button, and copy the
     repository URL (HTTPS).
   - Launch VS Code.
   - Clone the Repository: In the terminal, run: `git clone <repository-url>`. Replace
     `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied earlier. This will clone the repository to your
     local machine.

6. Install Extensions for VS Code

   - Node.js Extension: Install the Node.js extension in VS Code for better integration:

     - Open VS Code and go to the Extensions sidebar (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
     - Search for "Node.js Extension Pack" and install it.
     - GitHub Extension: To integrate GitHub with VS Code: In the Extensions sidebar, search for
       "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" and install it.

7. Install Dependencies

   - Navigate to the Project Directory: In the terminal, change into the cloned project directory:
     `cd <project-directory>`
   - Install Node Dependencies: `npm install`

8. Create a Branch for Your Work

   - Check Current Branch: `git branch`
   - Create a New Branch: `git checkout -b branch name`

9. Make Changes and Test

   - Edit Files: Open the files in VS Code and make your changes.

10. Commit and Push Changes to GitHub

    - Add Changes: `git add`
    - Commit Changes: `git commit -m "Added my new feature"`
    - Push Changes: `git push origin branch name`

11. Create a Pull Request (PR)

    - Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
    - Create a Pull Request: There should be an option to "Compare & pull request." Click it, review
      your changes, and submit the pull request.

# Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up a working environment for SplashKit with GitHub, VS Code and NodeJS.

Step 1: Install Git
Before you start, ensure you have Git installed on your system.
-Windows: Download Git from (link) and install it.
- macOS: Git should already be installed, but you can install it with Homebrew:  
With command brew install git in terminal.
- Linux: Use the package manager:  
 With command sudo apt-get install git in terminal.

Step 2: Download and Install VS Code
-Download VS Code:
Visit the official VS Code download page and select the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
-Install VS Code:
o	Windows: Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the installation wizard.
o	macOS: Open the .dmg file and drag the Visual Studio Code icon to the Applications folder.
o	Linux: Install using the appropriate package manager or by downloading the .deb or .rpm package from the website.
-Launch VS Code: Once installed, launch Visual Studio Code.

Step 3: Download and Install Node.js
-Download Node.js:
Go to the official Node.js website(link) and download the LTS version for your operating system.
-Install Node.js:
o	Windows: Run the downloaded .msi file and follow the installation wizard.
o	macOS: Open the .pkg file and follow the instructions.
o	Linux: You can use a package manager or install it from NodeSource.

-Verify Installation:
Open a terminal (or command prompt) and check if Node.js is installed correctly by running:
node -v
This should return the version number of Node.js.
Also, verify the installation of npm (Node Package Manager) by running:
npm -v
This should return the version of npm installed.

Step 4: Fork a GitHub Repository
-Log in to GitHub: Go to [GitHub] and log in.
-Find the Repository: Navigate to the splashKit repository (link).
-Fork the Repo: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

Step 5: Clone the Forked Repository
-Copy the URL: Go to your forked repository, click on the green "Code" button, and copy the repository URL (HTTPS).
-Launch VS Code.
-Clone the Repository: In the terminal, run:
   git clone <repository-url>
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied earlier. This will clone the repository to your local machine.

Step 6: Install Extensions for VS Code
-Node.js Extension: Install the Node.js extension in VS Code for better integration:
   - Open VS Code and go to the Extensions sidebar (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
   - Search for "Node.js Extension Pack" and install it.
   - GitHub Extension: To integrate GitHub with VS Code: In the Extensions sidebar, search for "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" and install it.

Step 7: Install Dependencies 
-Navigate to the Project Directory: In the terminal, change into the cloned project directory:
 cd <project-directory>
-Install Node Dependencies: 
  npm install

Step 8: Create a Branch for Your Work
-Check Current Branch:
   git branch
 -Create a New Branch:
   git checkout -b branch name

Step 9: Make Changes and Test
-Edit Files: Open the files in VS Code and make your changes.

Step 10: Commit and Push Changes to GitHub
Add Changes:
   git add
Commit Changes:
   git commit -m "Added my new feature"
 Push Changes:
  git push origin branch name

Step 11: Create a Pull Request (PR)
-Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
-Create a Pull Request: There should be an option to "Compare & pull request." Click it, review your changes, and submit the pull request.
